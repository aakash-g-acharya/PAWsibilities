The focus of our application is to facilitate the exchange of pets among pet lovers. It is a general-purpose application that can be used for donating, adopting, selling, and buying pets. It will help in connecting those who need a pet to those who want to get a responsible owner for their pet. Our application will contain a landing page, a Login page with a dashboard, pages to adopt, donate, sell, and buy pets. It will also mention the nearby pet shops where people can get new pets and medical attention for them. The login page will allow users to enter their credentials and they will be redirected to the dashboard. On the dashboard, they can see the details of all their requests for adopting or donating a pet. The page to adopt a pet will mention all the pets in the nearby area available for adoption. The person who wants to adopt will enter his details and why he is perfect for the pet. A request will be sent to the owner upon whose approval, his contact details will be shared so that they can communicate. Similarily for donating a pet, the owner will mention all the details of the pet and the kind of owner he wants for his pet. For the buying and selling of pets, the cost, and payments page will be added. The various frameworks and technologies that will be used for this application are HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, JQUERY, NODE JS /EXPRESS JS , React JS, and Mongo DB.
